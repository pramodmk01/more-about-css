					<h2> Indefinite article </h2>
					<p>Indefinite articles are used:
                       -with countable nouns when we don't know exactly which one we are referring to. For instance, 'The teacher is talking about a ten year old boy'. 
                       -while referring to a particular member of a group. For instance, 'John is a Catholic'. 
                       -to say what someone is or what job they do. For instance, 'He is a teacher.'
                       -with a singular noun to refer to all things of that kind. For instance, 'A dog is man's best friend.'</p><br>
